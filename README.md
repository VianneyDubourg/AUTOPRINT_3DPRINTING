# AUTOPRINT_3DPRINTING
This repository is built to show you how to print automatically with your 3D printer. No additional hardware is required, and this method works with almost all slicers. For example, in this tutorial, we discuss the Ender 3 V3 KE.
You can watch a video of the printer in action here: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ip12LMHYTdg .
